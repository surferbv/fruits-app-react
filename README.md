* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Current Spot:
- Now letâ€™s create one more controller called Home in a corresponding new file app/controllers/home_controller.rb that will be responsible for just one index page, where we are going to perform all of our React magic.

* Lessons learned:
- API based applications upload to a strict structure /app/contollers/api/v1. Where the v1 is the version of the api.
